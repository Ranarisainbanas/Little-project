# Little-project
## My little project to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, JS
This is a small website/blog for self-presentation, where I talk about myself and my hobbies.
here I will talk about the following things:
where did I study;
where I worked;
what I like to do;
where I have been on my travels.
I will tell you about all this in Russian, the site is built on “vanilla” HTML, CSS and JS.
The idea of this project is to consolidate theoretical knowledge in practice, as well as to remember a little about the basics of working with Git.
