## My little project to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, JS
This is a small website/blog for self-presentation, where I talk about myself and my hobbies.<br>
Here I will talk about the following things:
<ul>
<li>where did I study;</li>
<li>where I worked;</li>
<li>what I like to do;</li>
<li>where I have been on my travels.</li>
</ul>
I will tell you about all this in Russian, the site is built on “vanilla” HTML, CSS and JS.<br>
The idea of this project is to consolidate theoretical knowledge in practice, as well as to remember a little about the basics of working with Git.
